      <h1>WABI SABI</h1>
      <h1>Perfectly Imperfect</h1>
      <p>
        Often times, when we are faced by the reality of ourselves,we tend to
        see our imperfections and shortcomings. We tend to try and hide or
        change these parts of ourselves because in the contemporary world, life
        is aimed at achieving perfection, wealth, and a good socio-economic
        status. People live their lives trying to reach maximum perfection in
        their day-to-day lives. Wabi Sabi culture is the antithesis of modernism
        which aims at showing us that there is beauty in imperfection. So why
        not embrace these parts of us and instead of trying to fix them, we grow
        through them and find the beauty of who we are despite our
        imperfections.

          <h1>Background of Wabi Sabi</h1>
          <p>
            Wabi Sabi is a Japanese term which is used to describe a way of life
            that embraces imperfections of nature and finding beauty in them.
            Wabi refers to beauty seen in asymmetrical, unequal, uneven, and
            unbalanced things. An example of Wabi therefore maybe an
            asymmetrical ceramic bowl or crumpled linen. Sabi on the other hand
            is the beauty of old things and relates with the impermanence of
            life through the passage of time. It concentrates on how things
            grow, age and decay with the passing of time and how its beauty is
            displayed in items we had perceived as broken or passed by time.
            <br />
            . Kintsugi is an ancient art of Wabi Sabi whereby people mend broken
            objects with liquid gold giving them golden scars. A broken bowl or
            a tea pot therefore maybe mended by putting the pieces back together
            using gold fillings. This therefore makes them whole with cracks
            made of gold giving them an unusual beauty with permanent and
            imperfect flaws.By embracing these imperfections, we seek to find
            beauty in these objects which are mostly disregarded and
            unappreciated.
          </p>
          <h2>Embracing Wabi Sabi as our way of life</h2>
          <p>
            it is not only the beauty of the visual objects that we tend to seek
            but also in our way of life. Wabi Sabi is an unconventional approach
            to life which adopts principles that change our way of thinking and
            living. Through adoption of these principles, we change our
            attitudes with open minds. We accept ourselves and others for who we
            are without judgement. The Wabi Sabi lifestyle encourages
            self-acceptance and appreciating such imperfections. We therefore
            learn to live life as it is and lead positive lives regardless of
            the situations we are in. It is important to note that it is through
            our imperfections that we grow. If we were were all born perfect
            then there would be no need of self-development.Everybody will just
            be the same from when we first meet them and then when we see them
            again ten years later. The goal of self-development should therefore
            not be to change ourselves but rather to work on ourselves so that
            we can become the best versions of ourselves. We should also keep in
            mind that growth is relative, the best version of ourselves right
            now may not be the same in five years. As we learn and grow we are
            faced with more changes and our concept of reality also changes as
            we also change internally to the version that fits the present
            moment. There is therefore no point in time that we can say that we
            are perfect because then, what is life? Why are you here if not to
            learn and grow? So learn to love yourself as you are, learn to be
            less critical with yourself and instead use your imperfections as a
            canvas to craft your ideal self.

          <h2>Modern day Wabi Sabi</h2>
          <p>
            The Wabi Sabi culture has been incorporated into the modern
            lifestyle in the form of arts and craftmanship used in home d√©cor.
            Designers now use the Wabi Sabi interior design to make a room look
            minimal but expensive, imperfect but beautiful. It finds luxury in
            imperfect objects which displays beauty and wealth. It is now used
            in luxurious hotels and homes. Beauty in imperfection is a motto we
            should all live by. " By encouraging individuals to find beauty in
            imperfection and appreciate the transient nature of life, Wabi Sabi
            becames a guiding philosophy for cultivating mindfullness and
            contentment. Beyond its philosophical aspects, Wabi Sabi influences
            design and creativity- Ivan Cardona"

          <p>
            Alan Brenat- "When we are young, we think life will be a su po:one
            fabric, one weave, one grand design. But in truth, life turns out
            out to be more like the patchwork cloths- bits and pieces, odds and
            ends- people,places,things we never expected, never wanted perhaps.
            There is harmony in this, to and beauty."

          <p>Simon Van Booy- " Beauty is the shadow of imperfection"</p>
          <p>
            Brene Brown- " You are imperfect, you are wired for struggle, but
            you are worthy of love and belonging. Imperfections are not
            inadequacies, they are reminders that we are all in this together."
          </p>
          <p>
            Stephen Hawking-"One of the basic rules of the universe is that
            nothing is perfect. Perfection simply doesn't exist.....Without
            imperfection, neither you nor i would exist."
          </p>
          <p>
            Ozan Kulcu- " Growth is nothing more than transforming your
            imperfections into strengths."

          <p>
            -" Oh my darling, it's true, beautiful things have dents and
            scratches too."

            -"Don't strive for perfection. Strive for progress. Imperfection is
            part of the journey."
