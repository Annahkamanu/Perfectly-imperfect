      <h1>Perfectly Imperfect</h1>
      <p>
        Often times, when we are faced by the reality of ourselves,we tend to
        see our imperfections and shortcomings. We tend to try and hide or
        change these parts of ourselves because in the contemporary world, life
        is aimed at achieving perfection, wealth, and a good socio-economic
        status. People live their lives trying to reach maximum perfection in
        their day-to-day lives. Wabi Sabi culture is the antithesis of modernism
        which aims at showing us that there is beauty in imperfection. So why
        not embrace these parts of us and instead of trying to fix them, we grow
        through them and find the beauty of who we are despite our
        imperfections.
